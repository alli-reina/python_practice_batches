# Program: Print the Quotient of Two Numbers
# This program asks the user to input two numbers and prints the quotient (integer division) of the two numbers

# Ask the user for two numbers
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the quotient and print the result
quotient = num1 // num2
print("Quotient:", quotient)
