# Python Programming Batches
Hey there! This repo has a bunch of Python exercises organized into different batches to help you get the hang of programming. Each batch is in its own folder so you can easily find what you're looking for.

## Folder Structure
The exercises are split into the following folders:

*basic_arithmetic_operations_and_comparison* - Simple arithmetic and comparison problems.
*advanced_arithmetic_and_conditional_program* - A bit more complex arithmetic and conditional problems.
*list_processing_and_user_input* - Exercises focusing on handling lists and getting input from the user.
*user_input_and_processing_advanced* - Advanced user input handling and data processing.

## Exercises
#### Batch 01 - Basic Arithmetic Operations and Comparison
This is in the basic_arithmetic_operations_and_comparison folder.

Prog01: Print the bigger of two numbers.
Prog02: Print "Equal" if the two numbers are the same.
Prog03: Print the sum of two numbers.
Prog04: Print the product of two numbers.
Prog05: Print the quotient (with decimal).
Prog06: Print the first number raised to the power of the second.
Prog07: Print the sum of 10 numbers.
Prog08: Count how many odd numbers you get from 10 inputs.
Prog09: Print even numbers from 0 to 100 using a loop.
Prog10: Print numbers from 0 to 100, but skip the ones ending in 0.

#### Batch 02 - Advanced Arithmetic and Conditional Programs
This one’s in the advanced_arithmetic_and_conditional_program folder.

Prog01: Print the smaller of two numbers.
Prog02: Print "Not Equal" if the two numbers are different.
Prog03: Print the difference between two numbers.
Prog04: Print the quotient without a decimal.
Prog05: Print the remainder of a division.
Prog06: Subtract all 10 input numbers from the first one.
Prog07: Count the even numbers from 10 inputs.
Prog08: Print odd numbers from 0 to 100 using a while loop.
Prog09: Print numbers from 0 to 100, but skip ones that end in 0 or 5.
Prog10: Print all the numbers between two inputted numbers.

#### Batch 03 - List Processing and User Input
This one’s in the list_processing_and_user_input folder.

Prog01: Show all unique numbers from 10 inputs.
Prog02: Show all numbers, but skip duplicates after the first one.
Prog03: Keep asking for a number until you get an invalid input. Tell if the number is "Unique" or "Duplicate."
Prog04: Keep asking for numbers and display the smallest one when you get an invalid input.
Prog05: Keep asking for numbers and show them sorted in ascending order.

#### Batch 04 - Advanced User Input and Processing
This one’s in the user_input_and_processing_advanced folder.

Prog01: Show numbers that have duplicates from 10 inputs.
Prog02: Keep asking for numbers and show the most frequent one when you get an invalid input.
Prog03: Keep asking for numbers and display the highest number when you get an invalid input.
Prog04: Keep asking for numbers and display them sorted in descending order.
Prog05: Keep asking for numbers and display the average of the numbers.
