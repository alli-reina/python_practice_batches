# Program: Display Numbers from Highest to Lowest
# This program asks the user to input numbers and displays them from highest to lowest.

# Create an empty list to store numbers
numbers = []

# Ask the user to input numbers until they enter something that's not a number
while True:
    num = input("Enter a number (or leave blank and press enter to stop): ")
    if num.isdigit():  # Check if the input is a number
        numbers.append(int(num))  # Add the number to the list
    else:
        break  # Stop asking for numbers when the input is not a number

# If numbers were entered, sort them from highest to lowest and display
# Sort the list from highest to lowest
# Print the ascending order
