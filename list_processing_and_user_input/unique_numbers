# Program: Display all numbers that don't have duplicates
# This program asks the user to input 10 numbers and displays only unique numbers

# Initialize an empty list to store numbers
numbers = []

# Ask user to input 10 numbers
for i in range(10):
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Input number from the user
    if num not in numbers:  # Only add if not already in the list
        numbers.append(num)

# Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set, then back to a list
# Display unique numbers
